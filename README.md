# Birthday [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/railslove/birthday.png)](http://travis-ci.org/railslove/birthday)

This is a small gem that hooks into ActiveRecord and allows to tag a database field (date or datetime) as birthday, allowing to find birthdays with ease. This link is a blog post describing its implementation- The one lines above results in a 404. http://railslove.com/blog/2011/10/17/birthday-gem-easy-anniversaries-handling-ruby/

## How To Install

To install this gem, fire this command from your terminal:

    gem install birthday

or add this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'birthday', '~> 0.2.0'

## Synopsis

After installing this gem, you are able to work with anniversaries, such as birthdays in such a manner:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

      acts_as_birthday :birthday

    end

Add `acts_as_birthday :field_name` to your ActiveRecord model (or symbols for multiple fields, if you need to), and right away you can access methods:

* `birthday_age` - which will calculate current anniversary/age from the point in time,
* `birthday_today?` - which will return true or false, depending on whether the anniversary happens today.

### Created instance methods

If you add more fields to `acts_as_birthday` method, like:

    acts_as_birthday :birthday, :anniversary, :something_else

it will automatically create methods: `birthday_age`, `birthday_today?`, `anniversary_age`, `anniversary_today?`, `something_else_age`, `something_else_today?`.

### Created scopes

On top of that you get useful scopes: `birthday_today`, `find_birthdays_for`, `anniversary_today`, `find_anniversaries_for`, `something_else_today`, and `find_something_elses_for`.

These scopes accept maximum of two parameters, which have to respond to method `to_date` (by default objects of class Date, Time and DateTime). Thanks to these now you can search for birthdays...

* today:

        # Let's say today is April 24th:
        > User.birthday_today
         => [#<User id: 56, birthday: "1976-04-24">]

* on a specific date:

        > User.find_birthdays_for(Date.parse('04-04-2000'))
         => [#<User id: 23, birthday: "1961-04-04">, #<User id: 34, birthday: "1985-04-04">]

* between a specific range:

        > User.find_birthdays_for(Date.parse('04-04-2000'), Date.parse('05-04-2000'))
         => [#<User id: 23, birthday: "1961-04-04">, #<User id: 34, birthday: "1985-04-04">, #<User id: 56, birthday: "1976-04-24">, #<User id: 57, birthday: "1958-04-30">, #<User id: 60, birthday: "1986-05-04">]

* and even at the turn of the years:

        # This will search for birthdays between 12.12 and 3.01
        > User.find_birthdays_for(Date.parse('12-12-2000'), Date.parse('03-01-2001'))
         => [#<User id: 1, birthday: "1961-12-14">, #<User id: 12, birthday: "1985-12-15">, #<User id: 25, birthday: "1961-12-24">, #<User id: 27, birthday: "1985-01-01">, #<User id: 40, birthday: "1961-01-02">]

Since all these are essentially scopes, there's nothing stopping you from chaining them with other scopes:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

      acts_as_birthday :birthday

      scope :admins, {:is_admin => true}
      scope :named_like, lambda { |name| { :conditions => [ "first_name LIKE :q OR email LIKE :q OR last_name LIKE :q", { :q => "%#{name}%" } ] } }

    end


    > User.admins.named_like("Mike").find_birthdays_for(Date.parse('12-12-2000'), Date.parse('03-01-2001'))

### Your own adapters

At this moment, this gem supports only MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. If you want to support another type of database (perhaps SQLite), you can write your own adapter.

You can create your own birthday adapters for the ORM adapters we're not supporting yet by writing a class with a class method `scope_hash`, which will return a hash normally used in `active_record` scopes.

    module Railslove
      module Acts
        module Birthday
          module Adapter
            class SqliteAdapter
              def self.scope_hash(field, date_start, date_end)
                # do some magic and return scope hash you can use
                # field is the field used in the database
                # date_start and date_end can be anything that responds to .to_date method
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

With this namespacing (`Railslove::Acts::Birthday::Adapter`) and naming the class after `active_record`'s ORM adapter (like `SqliteAdapter` in the example above) you can automatically use your own adapters with this gem.

If you happen to write one of the adapters, don't hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/railslove/birthday/pull/new/master)! You will help the whole Ruby community with it!
